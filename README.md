> Collect from many noisy, biased sources → enrich with financial NLP → route the signal to the dashboards that need it. The same primitives power a China intelligence engine that estimates a *hidden state* from sensors no single one of which can be trusted.

## What this is

Social Scraper is a Python **collector → processor → API** platform for financial and
geopolitical open-source intelligence. It pulls from 15 source types on configurable
schedules, runs each record through a financial-NLP pipeline (sentiment, entity
recognition, topic and threat classification, embeddings), and routes the result to
downstream analytics dashboards based on relevance.

Every collector follows the same contract — `collect() → parse() → validate()`,
subclassing `core.base_collector.BaseCollector` and registered in `config/sources.yaml`
— so adding a new sensor is a single file plus a config entry. That uniformity is what
makes the China-intelligence layer below possible: it's just *more sensors*, scored by
the same machinery.

## Flagship: PALIMPSEST — China latent-state intelligence

**An independent, OSINT-driven read on what's actually happening inside China.** It treats
"the true state of China" as a hidden variable estimated from many biased sensors — no
single official figure is trusted; signal comes from *triangulation*. Two engines feed one
dark "intelligence terminal" dashboard:

| Engine | What it measures | Method |
|---|---|---|
| **DDTI** — Deletion-Differential Threat Index | *Treats the censor as a sensor.* What the regime deletes, how fast, and how selectively reveals what it fears. | Ranks censored topics by **threat = attention (time-decayed frequency) × novelty (burst / first-appearance)** from China Digital Times deletion data. |
| **CBB** — China Beige-Book-style conditions engine | Sector × region economic **diffusion indices**, independent of official NBS statistics. | `D = 0.4·SD + 0.6·AS` over four independent signal families (below). |

### CBB signal families

The conditions engine no longer rests on official trade data alone — it fuses four
*independent* sensor families, each a credentials-free public source that degrades
gracefully when unreachable:

| Family | Sensors | Reads… |
|---|---|---|
| 🛰️ **Physical anchors** | VIIRS nighttime lights · Sentinel-2 scene counts · electricity generation (Ember/OWID) · AIS port-call traffic | Real economic activity from space and the grid — hard to fake. |
| 🏛️ **Elite signals** | Politburo meeting readouts · Hong Kong RVD property index · People's Daily byline frequency · SAFE balance-of-payments net errors | The regime's own behavior and capital-flow tells. |
| 📈 **Trade & indicators** | UN Comtrade mirror-trade · Chinese high-frequency indicators (`collectors/cn_hf/`) | Cross-checked partner-reported trade vs. domestic high-frequency prints. |
| 🗣️ **Sentiment** | Chinese finance/policy lexicon, negation-aware hawkish/dovish/sector scoring | Tone and policy direction in Chinese-language text. |

Every source is checked by a dedicated **quality layer** (`processors/cbb_quality.py`,
covered by `tests/`) — schema validation, numeric sanity, and freshness windows — so a
stale or malformed feed is flagged rather than silently degrading the index.

### View it

- **Offline:** open `dashboards/palimpsest_dashboard.html` (real data embedded, badged ● SNAPSHOT).
- **Served:** run the API → `GET /api/v4/ddti/app` (panels fetch live, badge ● LIVE).
- **Refresh data:** `python -m scripts.ddti_live_pull` (censorship) · `python scripts/conditions_pull.py` (economy).

```

Data flows through three stages. **Collection**: 26 collectors pull from social platforms,
financial APIs, RSS, dark web, and China physical/elite sensors on schedules managed by
Celery Beat; raw content is published to Kafka and archived in MinIO. **Processing**:
NLP workers consume from Kafka — sentiment, entity extraction, topic/threat classification,
embeddings, plus the PALIMPSEST DDTI and CBB index processors. **Routing**: the smart
router scores each record and forwards it to DragonScope, LiquiFi, or both.

## Design principles

- **Estimate the hidden state, don't trust any single sensor.** Every signal is one
  biased measurement; value comes from cross-source triangulation, not from any one feed.
- **Independent of official statistics.** Physical anchors (nightlights, electricity,
  shipping) and partner-reported mirror-trade replace self-reported figures wherever possible.
- **Honest data states.** Every view badges LIVE / SNAPSHOT / SAMPLE — the system never
  fabricates signal to fill a gap, and the CBB quality layer flags stale or malformed feeds.
- **Graceful degradation.** Sources behind auth walls or geo-blocks return empty and log a
  warning rather than crashing the pipeline.
- **Egress reality.** Richer Chinese deletion/Weibo feeds need an in-China residential
  proxy; current data is what's openly reachable — and labeled as such.
